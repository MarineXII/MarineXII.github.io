				<h1 class="contentHeadings">Brief Description</h1>
				<div class="contentBody">
					I am a Bsc Computer Science studen currently studying at the University of Pretoria. I first started programming at the age of 15. My initial inspirations to get into coding was developing plugins for Bukkit servers for Minecraft. I then took more interest in software development and did IT in grade 10 to 12 through an online course by SSIR. The first programming language that I had worked with was Java, however, in IT I worked with Delphi.
					I enjoy coding because I feel good everytime I'm able to create a new piece of software that performs some task.<br><br>
					Computer Science was not the field of study that I initially wanted to go into. I wanted to study medicine which my parents were very supportive of. I eventually decided to switch to Computer Science when I started working more with computers and started playing more video games. I became interested in how video games were created and the code behind the games.
